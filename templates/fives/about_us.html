    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
        Football Fives Finder is the brainchild of University of Glasgow students Gordon Daffurn, Hangil Ko and Nicola Mossner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our goal was to create a web application that allowed users to find or create five-a-side games of football. Whether it was for a group of individuals struggling to get enough players, or for those who were looking to make new friends through football, we aimed to deliver a service that could suit everyone's needs.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Everyone who visits the site can view the list of games available.</li>
        <li>The list of games can be filtered by game type, duration, minimum number of free spaces, and maximum price.
        We hope this provides users the ability to quickly refine the list of games to those that match their requirements.</li>
        <li>Users are required to register and login to:
            <ol>
                <li>Create their own game.</li>
                <li>Join a game (with available spaces).</li>
                <li>View other users' accounts.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Players can rate other participants from a game after the game has finished. This can only be done once, in order to
        improve the integrity of users' ratings.</li>
        <li>Users who host their own game are responsible for overseeing it. This includes removing players (for any reason they deem necessary), and
        booking the pitch (if required). More information is available on the homepage once users have logged in.</li>
    </ul>
